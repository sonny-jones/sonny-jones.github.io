<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Built a custom Python ML library with cross‑validation to support ID3, perceptron, logistic‑regression, and SVM classifiers. </li>
    <li>Leveraged library to secure a top‑10 finish out of 150+ teams in a course Kaggle NLP classification challenge. </li>
    <li>Performed feature transformation, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning to increase model accuracy. </li>
    <li>Algorithms: ID3 decision tree, mistake‑bound perceptron, MLE/MAP logistic regression, objective‑minimization SVM, ensemble methods (bagging, AdaBoost, SVM‑over‑trees)</li>
    <li>Keywords: Python, Decision Tree, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, SVM, Ensembles </li>
  </ul>
