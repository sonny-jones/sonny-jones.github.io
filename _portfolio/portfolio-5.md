<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Utilized SVD to identify trends in player statistics for Valorant. </li>
    <li>Identified multiple significant statistics that might help differentiate players by rank. </li>
    <li>Developed an NN (Multilayer Perceptron) classifier to predict player rank from player statistics.</li>
    <li>Software: Python, Jupyter, Sklearn, SciPy </li>
    <li>Keywords: SVD, MLP </li>
