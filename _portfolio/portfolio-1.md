title: "[[Fine-Tuning Faster R-CNN for Guardrail Damage Detection](https://github.com/sonnyjones123/BlyncsySFT)]"
excerpt: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Researched and implemented advanced fineâ€‘tuning strategies on a Faster Râ€‘CNN to detect guardrail damage, improving detection accuracy by 5% and decreasing false positives by 92% for <a href="https://www.blyncsy.com/">Blyncsy, Inc.</a> </li>
    <li>Designed a saliencyâ€‘scoring pipeline leveraging preâ€‘trained networks to automatically verify ground truth labels in the training and testing sets, automatically finding errors in roughly 10% of images. </li>
    <li>Engineered endâ€‘toâ€‘end training pipelines for a custom Faster Râ€‘CNN, packaged as the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/BlyncsySFT/">BlyncsySFT</a> pip package for easy deployment and reproducibility. </li>
    <li>Keywords: Python, PyTorch, Object Detection, pip </li>
  </ul>
