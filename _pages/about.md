### About Me 📰

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their applications in medicine and rehabilitation robotics. I am particularly focused on reinforcement learning and continual learning—specifically, how we can build machines that learn and adapt to their environment over time.

Currently, I work at the intersection of human-centered robotics and AI, developing adaptive control systems for exoskeletons to assist post-stroke individuals in navigating complex and changing terrains. My previous work includes designing wireless sEMG systems, building automated pipelines for processing wearable sensor data, and creating cognitive workload assessment tools for advanced neuroprosthetic systems.

I’m passionate about advancing intelligent systems that improve human health and mobility, and I’m always open to collaborative opportunities in AI, robotics, and biomedical innovation.

Let's innovate together!
