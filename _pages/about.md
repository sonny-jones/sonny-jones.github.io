### About Me üì∞

As a passionate data-driven researcher, I thrive on collaboration and innovation, particularly in leveraging machine learning to revolutionize healthcare. I contribute to cutting-edge projects at the NERVES Lab and the Utah NeuroRobotics Lab at the University of Utah. My work included designing wireless sEMG chips, programs to process body-worn sensor signals automatically, and developing cognitive workload measurements for complex machine learning systems for neuroprosthesis. 

I am working to create advanced learning systems that use state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to control exoskeletons for post-stroke assistance while walking on and between different terrains. I seek opportunities to develop my data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning expertise and drive impactful research through collaborative endeavors.

Let's innovate together! #ML #AI # RL#DataScience
